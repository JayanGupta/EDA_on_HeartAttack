# Heart Attack Data EDA Project

## Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on heart attack data to visualize and understand the distributions and correlations of key variables such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships that may influence heart attack risk, providing insights for further analysis and modeling.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the EDA process.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

##Results
The EDA provided several insights:

Age and cholesterol levels showed a positive correlation with heart attack risk.
Visualizations indicated that males have a higher incidence of heart attacks compared to females.
Chest pain type and maximum heart rate achieved were significant indicators of heart attack risk.
Heatmaps and pair plots helped identify multicollinearity between certain features, guiding feature selection for further modeling.
